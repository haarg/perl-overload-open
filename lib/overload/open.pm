=head1 NAME

overload::open - Hooks the native open function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use overload::open 'my_callback';
  my %opened_files;
  sub my_callback { return if !@_; $opened_files{shift}++ }
  overload::open->prehook_open(\&my_callback);
  open my $fh, '>', "foo.txt";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module hooks the native C<open()> and/or C<sysopen()> functions and passes the
arguments first to your function and then calls sends it
to the provided subroutine functions instead.
It does this using XS and replacing the OP_OPEN/OP_SYSOPEN opcode's with an XS
function. This function will call your provided sub, then once that returns
it will run the original OP.

This function I<should> work fine if you call C<open> or C<sysopen> inside the callback.

You are not allowed to pass XS subs as the callback because then this could result
in a recursive loop. If you need to do this, wrap the XS function in a native Perl
function.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item prehook_open

  use overload::open
  overload::open->prehook_open(\&my_sub)

Runs a hook before C<open> by hooking C<OP_OPEN>. The provided sub reference
will be passed the same arguments as open.

=item prehook_sysopen

  use overload::open;
  overload::open->prehook_sysopen(\&my_sub)

Runs a hook before C<sysopen> by hooking C<OP_SYSOPEN>. Passes the same arguments
to the provided sub reference as provided to sysopen.
