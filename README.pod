=head1 NAME

overload::open - Hooks the native open function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use overload::open 'my_callback';

  open my $fh, '>', "foo.txt";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module hooks the native open() function and sends it to your
function instead. It passes the filename opened as its argument. It does this
using XS and replacing the OP_OPEN opcode with a custom one, which calls the
Perl function you supply, then calls the original OP_OPEN opcode.
